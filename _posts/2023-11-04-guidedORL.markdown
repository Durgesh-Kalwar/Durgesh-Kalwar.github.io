In this paper, we proposed an approach called GORL (Guided Offline-RL) that leverages a safety expert to guide the offline RL agent in choosing safe actions in uncertain states. This approach can be applied to existing offline RL algorithms and has been shown to outperform current methods in terms of safety without sacrificing performance.
