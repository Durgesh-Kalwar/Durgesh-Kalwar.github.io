In this paper, we considered the problem of designing a sequential decision-making agent to maximize an unknown time-varying function that switches with time. The agent is also constrained to make safe decisions with a high probability during the exploration phase. For this safe sequential optimization problem, we proposed an algorithm called Adaptive-SafeOpt, which incorporates Bayesian optimization and change point detection.
